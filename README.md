# Advanced Cybersecurity Concepts in Networks

## Course Overview

**Level:** Advanced **Delivery:** Hybrid (in-class/online) **Duration:** 35 hours (10 hours synchronous / 25 hours asynchronous) **Target Audience:** Undergraduate students in Automation & Computers or Electronics & Telecommunications.

## Prerequisites

**Knowledge:** Basic Telecom/Security (TCP/IP, LAN, WAN) and IP technology.

**Technical Familiarity:** Network devices (switches, routers) and simulation environments (e.g., Cisco, Juniper, Palo Alto, Fortinet).

**Equipment:** Personal laptop.

## Curriculum

The course covers theoretical notions and practical labs focusing on the following topics:

**LAN Security:** Network segmentation, traffic isolation, and local network security principles.

**Switch Configuration:** Port security, DHCP snooping, BPDU guard, and administrative access.

**WLAN Security:** Threat mitigation (Rogue AP, Evil Twin), encryption (WPA2/3), and authentication.

**Threats & Vulnerabilities:** Malware types, network attacks (scanning, spoofing, MitM), and TCP/UDP vulnerabilities (SYN flood, UDP amplification).

**Cryptography:** Symmetric/asymmetric encryption, hashing, and digital signatures.

**Network Controls:** Standard/Extended ACLs, NAT types, VPN site-to-site/remote, and IPsec architecture.

## Learning Objectives

**Identify and analyze security threats in LAN/WLAN environments.**

**Configure switch and wireless security measures for real infrastructures.**

**Apply cryptography and evaluate protocol vulnerabilities.**

**Implement traffic filtering (ACL), isolation (NAT), and secure connectivity (VPN/IPsec).**

**Design and implement a small, secure telecommunications infrastructure.**
